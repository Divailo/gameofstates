# gameofstates
The idea came during during BrumHack 2.0 to me and my friend. Sadly we did not have the time to finish it. Still working
on it and it is still very far away from functional. There is only some cool front-end stuff.

Our actual idea for the game to be something like Sid Meier's Civilization - you build and train stuff and conquer
everybody else on the map.

In order to run the application put the jar and the ArcGISRuntime10.2.4 folder on the same folder. It runs only
on windows 7 64-bit and even on this OS the map from the ArcGIS SDK will not run for some reason.
